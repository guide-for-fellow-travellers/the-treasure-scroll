<h1>The Quest for the Treasure Scroll</h1>

  <p>So... I guess now you know what I meant when I said I was learning a little coding.
      Apparently this is the best HTML a couple of evenings of googling get you, so here is a slightly
      janky webpage to start you off.</p>

  <p>I thought a simple link, or playlist description would have been way too easy to decipher for a true
  puzzle expert as yourself, so I made this puzzle a little more complicated. While we are at it, puzzle
  is perhaps a little reductive, let's call it a quest, now that sounds more adventurous...</p>

  <p>Here is a little code for you to start you off, remember what we said? "..." is your best friend.</p>

  <!--Centered Image Start-->

  <p style="font-size: 35px"><b>A3 38 2E 96 31 EA A0 47 C0 0F 9C 03 73 F5 0E 20 6F C5 68 42 29 8B D8 E1 42 02 9E F9 63 18 C3 59 8A 15 23 1F DF A4 31 6C 19 C7 61 14 FC 54 4B 06 64 2B 86 9F 9B EC 0D E0 EC 0C 77 F6 96 95 9A C5 A2 31 C3 23 1A 3C 8B D4</b></p>

  <p>So anyway, that's your code, here is your key. Easy-peasy.</p>

 <button onclick="document.location='https://guide-for-fellow-travellers.github.io/a-hidden-key/index.html'" style="font-size: 30px">THE KEY</button>

  <p>Enjoy your quest!</p>
